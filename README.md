# NeoC5 🚴‍♂️✨

**A modern revival of the Sinclair C5, blending nostalgia with technology.**

NeoC5 is a personal project to "resto-mod" the iconic Sinclair C5 with modern features like Neopixel LEDs, satellite connectivity for live tracking, and a digital dashcluster.
This journey combines mechanical restoration, electrical engineering, and creative hacking.

....none of which I'm particularly good at, so this is going to be an interesting journey.

## 🌟 Vision

What I aim to do with the NeoC5:
- **Restore** the Sinclair C5 to a fully functional state.
- **Upgrade** it with modern technology for today's requirements and aesthetics.
- **Showcase** it at hacker events like [WHY2025](https://why2025.org).
  - I too, don't like arbitrary deadlines for stuff, so let's all agree that while I wanna show it off at WHY, it's probably not gonna be done, ok?
  - There, now your expectations are managed and I don't have unnecessary pressure.
- **Daily** it as a method of transportation.
  - Yup. So there'll be no speed mods and no OTT lighting that'll get me in trouble.
    - ok... maybe some OTT lighting.

## 📜 Project Roadmap

### **1. Mechanical Restoration**
- Replace and repair essential components:
  - Tires and inner tubes ✅
  - Chain and tensioner
  - Brakes and cables
- Ensure the C5 functions as a standard bike.

### **2. Electrical Rebuild**
- Research and implement a modern electric drivetrain.
  - Add a motor, battery, and wiring harness.
  - Integrate a throttle and basic pedal assist.

### **3. Cosmetic Restoration**
- Sand, repaint, and repair the body shell.
- Replace broken light lenses and external features.
- Polish for a clean, modern look.

### **4. Advanced Mods**
- Add **Neopixel LEDs** for lighting.
  - Animations, anyone? >.>
- Build a **digital dashboard** for speed, battery, and system stats.
- Experiment with **Iridium network integration** for live tracking.
  - Shamefully nicked from Blue & Q. But hey, now I know it's possible, I'd be an idiot to not even try.

*As of 31-01-2025 - Soon(tm) could be like, 4 weeks from now. Although, 4 weeks from now, I'd kinda like to have the Chain and tensioner and brakes sorted, which would also put me in Phase 2.... so that's a thing
